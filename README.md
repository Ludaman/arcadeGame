frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

I am Jeff Choate.  This is a game I created for my Front End NanoDegree course on Udacity.  I reused most of their code and created this fucntionality.

To get this game to load you should just need to download all the files in the currently laid out structure and load the index.html in any browser window.  Then the game can be played by using the arrow keys to move your player around.  If you get hit by a tumbling rock or a voracious lady bug then you get killed and sent back to the start.  If you make it to the safety of the water at the top then you will win and a dialog box will pop up to tell you just that!

Thanks, have fun!


---Old instructions from Udacity template
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
